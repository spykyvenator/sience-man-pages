speed refers to how far an object travels in a given time interval regardless of direction

Average speed = (distance traveled/time elapsed)

velocity refers to the magnitude of how fast an object is moving and the direction in which it is moving ( it is a vector)

average velocity = (displacement/time elapsed) = [(final position - initial position) / time elapsed]

instantaneous velocity is your velocity at the time of moving, it is more accurate on a smaller time interval hence the limit to zero of the time

instantaneous velocity = lim(\Delta t -> 0, \Delta x/\Delta t) = dx/dt

acceleration is your change in velocity 

average acceleration = (change of velocity / time elapsed)
a = (v2-v1)/(t2-t1) = (\Delta v/ \Delta t)

instantaneous acceleration is your acceleration at a particular time, it is more accurate on a smaller time interval hence the limit to zero of the time

instantaneous accurate = a = lim(\Delta t -> 0, (\Delta v/ \Delta t)) = dv /dt
