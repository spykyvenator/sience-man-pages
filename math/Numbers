.SS Functions
A function can be seen as an object that, when all it's parameters are filled in spits out another number

these are often written in the form f(variable) = expression

example: f(x) = x^2+2, here f(x) is our function with the variable x

.SSS Natural Numbers

these are the most simple nubers, noted with N
all numbers are positive and are without comma
all numbers in this collection can be written as a sum of a series of 1's

.SSS Integers

these are the Natural numbers plus it's negative counterpart noted with Z
all numbers can be written as a sum or a substraction of a series of 1's

.SSS Rational Numbers

rational numbers are all numbers that can be written as a division of two Integers (no division by zero)
written as Q

.SSS Real Numbers

each rational number is the solution to a linear expression: nx=m

where m and n are Integers

.SSS Irreal Numbers

each Irreal number is the solution to a function of a quadratic function

.SS Distance and intervals

with distance between two real numbers w mean d(a,b) = |a-b| or abs(a-b)
